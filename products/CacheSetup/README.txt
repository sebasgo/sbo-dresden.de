CacheFu 1.1

  CacheFu speeds up Plone sites transparently using a combination 
of memory, proxy, and browser caching. Can be used by itself or 
with Squid, Varnish, and/or Apache. CacheFu comes with a selection 
of auto-generated configs for different proxy configurations 
(if you are using apache by itself, no special configuration is needed).Once installed, your site should run much faster 
(~10x faster by itself, ~50x faster with squid).

CacheFu is currently shipped as a separate add-on to Plone as we expect several more releases in the near future to add additional features and flexibility.

The latest release (and the CacheFu manual) can be found at 
"http://plone.org/products/cachefu":http://plone.org/products/cachefu

Tested with Plone 2.5.3 and Plone 3.0.  Probably also works with Plone 2.5, 2.5.1, and 2.5.2 but no extensive testing has been performed on those versions.

Check the INSTALL.txt file for installation instructions.

(more docs, some a bit out-of-date, can be found in the /CacheSetup/docs directory)
