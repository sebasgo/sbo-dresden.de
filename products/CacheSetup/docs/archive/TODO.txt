** I NEED HELP ON THIS STUFF!! **

Stuff to do before 1.0 release
------------------------------
[In order of decreasing priority]

* DOCUMENTATION!!

* Make conditional GET handling deal properly with force-GETs

* Need a new class of cache rule that just takes a predicate
   as a selector.  We then should add one of these at the end 
   of the rule set that sets the private flag for all content 
   when people are authenticated - Cookie Crumbler normally does 
   this but it is overly zealous so the feature has been disabled

* Need some functional tests for page cache manager (there are 
   already some in in CacheSetup)

Please keep in mind the rules:
------------------------------

** You MUST run the unit tests before checking anything in.

** Unless you are checking in a unit test that demonstrates a bug,
   all unit tests must run before you do a check-in.

** If you add a new feature, you should add a unit test that
   exercises it.

** If you fix a bug, you should add a unit test that fails without
   your fix and passes with your fix.
