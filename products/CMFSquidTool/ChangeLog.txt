   - removed timeoutsocket.py and replaced it by using
     pythons native timeout support.
     this affects _pruneUrl

2005-05-09 Neil Kandalgaonkar <neilk at enfoldsystems.com>

   - Changes for compatibility with Enfold Enterprise Server, a
     proxy cache with features similar to Squid. Our changes will
     probably eventually be merged with the main release.

   - All squid urls have to be the relative path and _not_ the full url
     cause of virtual hosting situations. Reverted the changes from Pan
     which made the tool using absolute urls.

   - Fixed tons of typos.

   - Added german translation.

   - I found PURGE wasn't always work. After a look at squid's client.c,
     I found we should use HTTP/1.0, and use the full url when put request.

     So I change the squid urls to squid hosts. And prune url should be
     the full absolute url, but not the relative path.

   - Don't use getObject, use getURL instead, which is more light weight

2004-09-20 Pan Junyong <panjy at zopechina.com>

   - Add i18n.
   - Add skin for plone.
   - Refine the prune logic.

2003-12-09 Simon Eisenmann <simon at struktur.de>

   - Initial public release.
