InkStain 1.0rc1

ABOUT

   InkStain is a guestbook product.
   A guestbook allows people to leave message on your website
   a bit like a message board.


WHY ?

   Very strangely, Plone is a full solution for content management, but lacks
   some serious simple tools, like this very basic one : the guestbook.
   I decided to write few products in order to propose simple but yet very
   functional and easy-to-use tools for people who just want basic tools
   that WORK !
