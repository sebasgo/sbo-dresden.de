Collage developer documentation
===============================

The Collage product was built to be easily customizable.

Content views
-------------

New content views can be added by registering a browser view with
a browser:page-directive. Examples of this can be found in

  ./browser/views.zcml

A view for a standard document can be registered as follows:
  
  <browser:page
     name="my-view"
     for="Products.ATContentTypes.content.document.ATDocument"
     permission="zope.Public"
     template="my-view-template.pt"
     class=".document.MyDocumentView"
     layer="Products.Collage.interfaces.ICollageBrowserLayer"
     />

To display a human-readable title, we associate the view with the
following class, placed in a file document.py:

  from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

  class MyDocumentView(BrowserView):
      title = u'My view'


Content controls
----------------

Content controls are registered as viewlets. See ./browser/viewlets.zcml
for examples.
